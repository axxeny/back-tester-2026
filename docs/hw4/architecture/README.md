# Architecture documentation

This directory describes the implemented Homework 4 backtesting engine. It is
the entry point for understanding the system before reading the C++ or Python
code.

The engine replays Databento-like MBO JSONL data into a historical level-3
order book, schedules market data and strategy commands on one deterministic
virtual timeline, simulates private strategy orders, invokes Python callbacks,
and returns bulk pandas-compatible results.

## Architecture at a glance

    RING["SPSC event ring<br/>processed_seq barrier"]
    ENGINE["TradingEngine<br/>consumer thread"]

```

The mandatory runtime uses one process and two native worker threads. The
dispatcher is the only writer of the shared historical book. The trading
thread owns private orders, positions, matching state, and result writes.
`processed_seq` prevents the dispatcher from changing the book while the
trading thread is reacting to the current delivery.

- These architecture documents explain the behavior implemented by the current
  code and locked by the current tests.
- If documentation and executable behavior diverge, treat it as a defect:
  update the implementation and tests or correct the documentation in the same
  change.
