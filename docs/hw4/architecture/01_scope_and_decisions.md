# System scope and implemented behavior

## Purpose

This project is a deterministic, in-process options backtesting engine built
for an HFT course assignment. It demonstrates typed market-data ingestion,
historical book reconstruction, causal order scheduling, private order
matching, Python strategy callbacks, position/PnL accounting, and bulk result
delivery.

It is a backtester, not an exchange emulator or a complete options risk system.

## Implemented runtime

- One OS process.
- One dispatcher thread and one trading-engine consumer thread.
- Multiple instruments in one replay.
- Databento-like MBO JSONL input.
- Streaming, fail-fast parsing into numeric native types.
- A per-instrument historical L3 book.
- One private `EngineView` owned by the typed `SimulatedLOB`.
- Fixed market-data latency and strictly positive fixed order latency.
- Limit GTC orders, partial fills, resting orders, and cancel.
- Top-N Python book callbacks; default depth is 15.
- Full L3 replay even though Python receives an aggregated top-N view.
- Fill-at-touch matching across displayed historical depth up to the limit.
- Per-instrument positions, contract multipliers, FIFO realized PnL, and
  midpoint marking.
- Native columnar result buffers exposed as pandas DataFrames and a Series.
- Native, Python, end-to-end, determinism, sanitizer, and benchmark coverage.

Every strategy-facing event, order, position, and result row carries a numeric
`instrument_id`.

## Core behavioral rules

### One fill authority

`trading::SimulatedLOB` is the only component that creates synthetic fills.
The scheduler determines when a command arrives; the historical book provides
displayed liquidity; `TradingEngine` applies the resulting fill decisions to
order lifecycle, positions, results, and callbacks without independently
matching.

### One deterministic virtual timeline

```text
market delivery = exchange timestamp + market-data latency
order arrival   = callback-visible engine time + order latency
cancel arrival  = callback-visible engine time + order latency
```

At the same scheduled timestamp, priority is:

1. market delivery;
2. new-order arrival;
3. cancel arrival.

Source or command sequence is the stable tie-breaker within one class.

### Strict market-data barrier

The dispatcher publishes one scheduled event with a monotonically increasing
`dispatch_seq`. It does not mutate shared market state for the next event until
the trading thread publishes `processed_seq >= dispatch_seq`.

The acknowledgement occurs after matching, state updates, result recording,
Python callbacks, and command enqueue for the current event.

### Callback contract

Python strategies receive:

- `on_book_update(BookUpdate)`;
- `on_trade(Trade)`;
- `on_fill(Fill)`;
- `on_reject(Reject)`.

A book callback is emitted after a complete atomic source group and only when
the configured top-N view changes. For a market delivery, the observable order
is:

1. resting-order matching and fill callbacks;
2. trade callbacks in source order;
3. one book callback when top-N changed.

State, position, PnL inputs, and result rows are updated before `on_fill()` or
`on_reject()` runs.

### Non-recursive strategy commands

An order or cancel submitted from a callback enters the command ring with a
future scheduled arrival. It is never matched recursively on the callback's
C++ stack. Immediate validation rejects are deferred until the initiating
callback unwinds.

### Private historical consumption

A synthetic fill never mutates the source historical book. `SimulatedLOB`'s
`EngineView` records private consumption by instrument, historical side,
exchange order ID, and liquidity revision. Replaced liquidity at the same price
therefore becomes available without inheriting stale private depletion.

### Failure policy

Malformed input, chronology regressions, invalid configuration, native
exceptions, and Python callback exceptions fail the run. The runtime records
the first exception, requests stop, closes/wakes queues and barriers, joins both
threads, and rethrows to the caller. It does not silently continue with a
corrupted replay.

## Supported order lifecycle

```text
PendingNew
  -> Open | PartiallyFilled | Filled | Rejected
Open
  -> PartiallyFilled | Filled | PendingCancel
PartiallyFilled
  -> PartiallyFilled | Filled | PendingCancel
PendingCancel
  -> PartiallyFilled | Filled | Cancelled
```

Terminal states are `Filled`, `Cancelled`, and `Rejected`.

## Explicit limitations

- No sockets, IPC, multiple processes, or distributed services.
- No historical queue-position model, probabilistic fills, or market impact.
- No stochastic latency, jitter, or slippage.
- No replace/amend, market, stop, peg, post-only, IOC, FOK, or multi-leg
  orders.
- No self-matching between private strategy orders.
- No exercise, assignment, expiration settlement, Greeks, volatility surface,
  or complete options risk engine.
- No Feather input, database, persistence layer, UI, or generic plugin system.
- The shipped runtime has one trading `EngineView`; isolation between typed
  `SimulatedLOB` instances is tested but is not exposed by `backtest.run()`.
